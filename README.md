### What I learned

In the previous Frontend Mentor challenges, I mostly used Flexbox to lay out components. This time, I used Grid because I thought it was better suited to this challenge. I knew the basics of Grid but I had never really used it so I did have to read a couple guides on Grid (listed down below). After reading the guides, I felt much more comfortable with it and in the solution, I took full advantage of Grid area to layout the individual card components.

### Continued development

I found Grid to be extremely useful and I will definitely try to incorporate it into future projects.
